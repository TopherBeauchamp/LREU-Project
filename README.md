# Initial LREU Project
In this project, I use both adjacency matrix & adjacency list data structures to represent a network of data sensor nodes, and breadth-first search + depth-first search algorithms to traverse these and identify connected components of sensor nodes.  

# Purpose: 
The purpose of this project is to lay a foundation for the final algorithm that I will use to represent Professor Bin Tang's battery-constrained covering salesman problem that we plan to incorperate into a research paper. 



The final algorithm can be found here: [LREU-Final](https://github.com/TopherBeauchamp/LREU-Final) 


# Usage 
If you wish to use this code you can clone it by entering the following command into a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/TopherBeauchamp/LREU-Project
```

The code can be compiled in a terminal with the following commands:

### Compile Java Files: 
```
javac *.java
```
### Run main method: 
```
java SensorNetworkRunner
```
